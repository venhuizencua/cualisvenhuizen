			<h1>Assignment #1:  System Evaluation</h1>

			<h2>System Introduction</h2>
			<p>The <a href="http://en.childrenslibrary.org/index.html">International Chidren's Digital Library</a>, according to its website, was created over twenty years ago.  It's <a href="http://en.childrenslibrary.org/about/mission.html">mission </a> is to "promote tolerance and respect for diverse cultures by providing access to the best of chidren's literature from around the world."  The foundation states that children learn best in their mother tongue, and in the case of refugees and immigrants, accessing chidren's literature in the chidren's mother tongues can be a challenge.  It is this challenge that the ICDL seeks to overcome.  The ICDL is a non-profit corporation, and is supported by the University of Maryland's Department of Computer Science and College of Information Studies.</p>

			<h3>System Specification</h3>
			<p>In 2021, rather than shutting down the site, the site was simplified and moved to a new server.  The system is a very simple website, which includes a list of scanned chidren's books (which are part of the public domain, and therefore can be distributed online without legal concerns about copyright violation).  The collection can be browsed by genre, form, fiction or non-fiction, and most importantly, by language.  The collection includes more than 4400 books, in more than 70 different languages.  There is no search function included.</p>

			<h3>Users: target user description:</h3>
			<p>As the title reflects, the collection of books is intended for children, specificaly children who may lack access to books in their first language.
			</p>
			<h3>Discussion of system:</h3>
			<p>Technological discussion:  This is a basic website that organizes a collection of several scanned books for kids in several different languages.  Users can browse the collection based on the genre, fiction or non-fiction, as well as language (and some other options).  Once the user selects a work from the list, they can click on the title (only information given), and it opens up a simple web interface where the user can view one page at a time, and click a button to go back or forward a page, or return to the home screen.
			</p>

	<h3>Pros:</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>This is an ambitious project with well-meaning intentions</li>
			<li>The scans are legible--of reasonable, however not great quality and resolution</li>
			<li>The interface is simple, and loads quickly</li>
			<li>Visually, the layout and color selections are easy to read and understand and are not distracting</li>
		</ul>
	<h3>Cons:</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>The site is not very mobile friendly--it functions better on a desktop web browser</li>
			<li>Scrolling on a phone or smaller screen is challenging</li>
			<li>The size of the scanned page does not format itself to fit the screen--the user must zoom in our out to read the text and view images</li>
			<li>The website iteself does not provide links for explore the site in other languages--a user will need to understand English well enough to find their way to the texts in other languages</li>
		</ul>
			
		<h3>Conclusions</h3>	
		<p>Though this is an ambitious project, it has fallen short of the defined mission--perhaps most specifically in its aim to provide "the best" of children's literature.  It provides a limited selection of languages, and the texts represented are unbalanced accross languages.
		</p>
		<h4>Examples of the number of books included in a representative language</h4>
		
		<table>
			<tr>
				<th>Language</th>
				<th>Number of books available</th>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>English</td>
				<td>3142</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>Persian</td>
				<td>413</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>Spanish</td>
				<td>119</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>Tagalog</td>
				<td>7</td>
			</tr>
		</table>
		<p>As is evident in this table, there is a considerable disparity in the number of books available by language.  Books in English are overrepresented, and many languages have only a couple of books available.</p>
		<p>Furthermore, many of the scanned books are very old, and of limited interest to young children.  I suspect this choice was made by the developpers to include texts that are in the public domain, and thus the ICDL can avoid any legal issues stemming from copyright restrictions.</p>
		<p>Finally, This system is not particularly intuitive--especially for the target audience of children.  I think that kids can scroll through the pages of a chosen book using the buttons without major difficulties, but the consistent need to resize and scroll through individual pages could be challenging for a child.  Also, I think that a child would need assistance from an adult or older sibling to find the appropriate section of texts in a language they will understand.</p>
		<p>I would hope that kids living in a place with access to a modern library will be able to find better, more current books in their mother language through a library's collection.  However, if the creators of the ICDL were to make one single improvement, I would suggest making the format easier to view on a mobile phone or tablet.</p>
